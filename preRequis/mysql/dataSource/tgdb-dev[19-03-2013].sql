A human exploration expedition was activating dormant mass relays (which was a practice considered unsafe by citadel races). The turians attacked the small fleet and proceeded to capture the closest human world, Shanxi. The turians proceeded to starve out the remaining humans and occupy the planet. Facing starvation the human garrison surrendered to the Turian Hierarchy. One month later, the human Second Fleet responded by annihilating the turian fleet around Shanxi. In response the turians prepared for full scale war. The citadel council saw that humanity would either be annihilated or annexed by the turians and stepped in. The humans were then given an embassy in the Citadel Council.\r\nCitadel space, as a whole, is ruled by a body of government known as the Council, which is made up of members of the three prominent alien races: the asari, a race of mono-gendered aliens which closely resemble blue-skinned human females; the short-lived salarians; and the raptor-like turians.

As no lives are lost in the bonus areas, the bonus areas can be played through as often as the player desires until the bonus area can be cleared.[4] After completing all five levels in a chamber, a sixth button that opens a portal to a boss level will appear. By defeating the boss, the next chamber will become available for play.[2] When all 25 Crystals are found and all five boss characters are defeated, the game is won.[5]\r\nCrash and Coco start the game with four lives. Crash and Coco lose a life when they are struck by an enemy attack or suffer any other type of damage.

Grant himself is the final boss in the same location for the raptor storyline: your dinosaur character must cause the bone structure to collapse via specifically placed kicks to cause Grant to flee. A sequel was released using a new game engine and new artwork (with some of the original art as well), entitled Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition. In it, Grant\'s helicopter (that he just escaped on in the first game) crashes. Now he must deal not only with dinosaurs, but InGen as well. A new raptor must also make it off the island.', null, null, '1306632498', null, null, 'E - Everyone', '0', '0', '0', '0', '', 'no', '2011-05-31 04:18:40', '0', 'tv.com', 'No', null, null, '18', null, '', '', '', '', '', '', null, null, null, null);

Ultimately both of them plummet towards Earth, critically injured. Meanwhile, Mega Man and his canine companion Rush are called by Dr. Light to investigate strange energy readings on a nearby island. On the island, Mega Man finds Dr. Wily flying away with a strange purple orb. Before chasing him, he sees a damaged robot and asks for Dr. Light to pick it up and try to repair it. Dr. Wily then releases four new Robot Masters to combat Mega Man, Frost Man, Tengu Man, Clown Man, and Grenade Man. Each time he destroys one, the robotic hero receives a purple orb like the one Dr. Wily confiscated.

Although Kislev originally had the upper hand in the war, a mysterious army known as Gebler appeared and began to provide assistance to Aveh. With Gebler\'s help, the Aveh military not only recovered its losses, but began making its way into Kislev\'s territory. As the story unfolds, the setting broadens to encompass the entire world and the two floating countries, Shevat and Solaris.

Shevat has been the only country to evade the control of Solaris.\r\n\r\nMuch of Xenogears plot and backstory is detailed in the Japanese-only book Xenogears Perfect Works. This book, produced by the now defunct DigiCube, details the history of the Xenogears universe from the discovery of the Zohar to the start of the game.[8][9] According to the Perfect Works schematic (as well as the game\'s end credits), Xenogears is the fifth episode in a series of six.\r\n\r\nXenogears follows protagonist Fei Fong Wong and several others as they journey to uncover the truth behind mysterious, cabalistic entities operating in their world.

As they clear the ship and kill the Russian soldiers aboard, the ship is attacked by Russian MiGs and begins to sink. The team escapes with the cargo manifest, which provides evidence of ties between the Russian Ultranationalist Party and a rebel faction in the Middle East.\r\n\r\nRussian Ultranationalist leader Imran Zakhaev, who plans to return his motherland to the times of the Soviet Union, draws international attention away from his plans by funding a coup d\'état in an unnamed Middle Eastern country, organized by a local separatist leader named Khaled Al-Asad. Discovering the plot, the American government starts a police action to stop the uprising, while the SAS continues to operate in Russia. After President Al-Fulani of the Middle Eastern country is executed on live television and Al-Asad takes control, the SAS rescue their compromised agent, Nikolai, from Russian Ultranationalist forces.\r\n \r\nOne section of the game takes place in Prypiat, Ukraine. Several iconic aspects of the abandoned city, such as this square, were recreated in the game.\r\n\r\nIn the American invasion of the Middle Eastern country, a platoon from the USMC 1st Force Recon, led by Lieutenant Vasquez, deploys to search for Al-Asad, but are too late, and proceed to aid other American units fighting the separatists. During the final stages of the operation, United States Central Command learns of Al-Asad\'s position in the capital, but is also notified by SEAL Team Six of a Russian nuclear weapon nearby, and sends the Nuclear Emergency Support Team to disarm it. However, the nuclear device suddenly detonates, leveling most of the city, killing his own army, citizens, and the US Invasion Force of 30,000 Marines. Just before the detonation, Vasquez\'s squad makes a last minute rescue of a pilot from a downed AH-1 Cobra. While fleeing the city, the helicopter is caught in the blast, killing everyone on board..\r\n\r\nThe British learn that Al-Asad fled the country before the American invasion, and is hiding in a safe house in Azerbaijan. With the help of Nikolai\'s intelligence and assistance from Loyalist Russian soldiers, the SAS clear the village of the Ultranationalist forces and capture and interrogate Al-Asad at his safe house. After listening to the voice calling Al-Asad\'s phone, Captain Price executes Al-Asad, now knowing that Zakhaev is Al-Asad\'s backer. Price then has a flashback of his mission to eliminate Zakhaev in Prypiat, Ukraine, 15 years earlier.\r\nIn the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster and the collapse of the Soviet Union, Zakhaev took advantage of the turmoil to profit from nuclear proliferation and used his new wealth to lure soldiers from the Soviet Army to form his Ultranationalist Party. In 1996, Price was paired with Captain MacMillan, a Scottish SAS captain, to carry out the black op assassination of Zakhaev. After sneaking into Prypiat and taking up a position in an abandoned hotel, MacMillan spotted Zakhaev, and Price hit him with a shot from a Barrett M82, but Zakhaev survived, losing an arm. Price and MacMillan were pursued, but escaped, with MacMillan sustaining an injured leg in the process.\r\nBack in the present day, a joint operation is conducted by Price\'s SAS unit, a USMC Force Recon unit led by Staff Sergeant Griggs, and Loyalist Russian forces led by Sergeant Kamarov, to stop Zakhaev. They capture his son Victor in an unnamed Russian city, to learn of Zakhaev\'s whereabouts, but as they corner him, Victor commits suicide to avoid being captured. Zakhaev becomes enraged, blaming Western nations for the death of his son, and plans to retaliate by launching ballistic missiles armed with nuclear warheads at the East Coast of the United States, with predicted losses of over 41 million people. When the Task Force operatives arrive at the facility in Russia, Zakhaev manages to launch ICBMs towards the United States. However, the squad successfully seizes the silo command room and remote detonates the missiles over the Atlantic. They escape the facility in military trucks with Zakhaev\'s forces in hot pursuit.\r\n\r\nBefore the squad can escape across a nearby bridge, it is destroyed by an Mi-24 Hind, leaving them trapped. Zakhaev\'s forces arrive and engage the remaining members of the strike force. Gaz receives a call from Kamarov, informing him that his forces are on their way to help. On the bridge, a gas tanker explodes, incapacitating most of the soldiers nearby, except Griggs, who is killed while trying to pull MacTavish to safety. Zakhaev, along with two of his soldiers, begin executing Gaz and other surviving members of the strike force. Before he reaches Soap and Price, he is distracted by the destruction of his gunship and the arrival of the Loyalist helicopters. As Zakhaev looks away, Price slides his pistol to Soap, who shoots and kills Zakhaev and his two guards.

The First Core was possessed by the Bentusi: a powerful and enigmatic race of traders who assisted the Exiles (the campaign can be played using Kushan or Taiidan craft in the original game) during the first game.

Scarcity of arable land and natural resources has coloured Kushan history with near constant inter-clan (or \"Kiith\") warfare.\r\nAs new technologies emerged, religious and political conflict partially gave way to unified scientific exploration. DNA sequencing of Kharak\'s native life revealed no genetic resemblance to the Kushan, giving rise to their \"XenoGenesis Theory\" - which stated that they were not native to Kharak at all.\r\nThe first space flights reinforced this idea. Small pieces of metallic debris, the largest no bigger than a hand, were retrieved from low orbit and, when analyzed, were found to be made up of materials totally unknown to Kushan metallurgy. In addition to helping accelerate their space technology research, the debris confirmed that a large advanced spacecraft had once been in orbit.

He then experiences a flashback from three years ago. Back in 1998, Max returned home to find that a trio of apparent junkies had broken into his house while high on a new designer drug called Valkyr. Max rushed to the aid his family, but was too late and his wife and their newborn daughter had already been brutally murdered. After his family\'s funeral, Payne transferred to the DEA.\r\nThree years later, Max Payne is employed as an undercover operative inside the Punchinello Mafia family responsible for the trafficking of Valkyr. His DEA colleague B.B. gives Max a message asking him to meet another DEA agent, who is also Max\'s best friend, Alex Balder, in the NYC Subway station. Max\'s arrival at the subway results in a shoot-out after he encounters mobsters working for Jack Lupino, a Mafia underboss in the Punchinello crime family, attempting a bank robbery by breaking through from the station. Working his way back to the surface, Max encounters Alex, who is then killed by an unknown assassin and Payne becomes the prime suspect in the murder. Additionally, the Mafia find out that he is a cop and now want him dead.', null, null, '1306660373', null, null, 'M - Mature', '0', '0', '0', '0', '', 'no', '2011-05-31 04:18:40', '0', 'tv.com', 'No', null, null, '1', null, '', '', '', '', '', '', null, null, null, null);

Norman. After announcing that he wants to be in the Witness Protection Program, Tommy proceeds to tell the story of how he got involved with a crime family headed by Ennio Salieri, providing the story\'s main narrative.\r\nWhile working as a cab driver in fictional Lost Heaven in 1930, Tommy picks up two mobsters, Sam and Paulie, who force him to help them lose two mobsters working for Salieri\'s rival, Don Morello. After losing them and delivering the two to their boss\' place, Tommy is rewarded a large amount of money. The next day, while taking a break, Tommy is attacked by the thugs he helped Sam and Paulie escape from. Though he is saved by Salieri\'s men, he subsequently loses his job. Desperate to make money, Tommy falls in with Salieri\'s crew and gets involved in all his criminal operations.\r\nOver the next 8 years, Tommy does big jobs for the family, such as murdering other gangsters, entering races, stealing, bootlegging (this is during Prohibition), robbing banks, and property destruction. He slowly rises through the ranks as the jobs get bigger, such as when he has to kill Salieri\'s double-crossing consigliere. Eventually, the rivalry between Salieri\'s crew and Morello\'s crew erupts into a war. This is where Tommy gets his biggest job: assassinating Morello, ending the feud once and for all. During this time, Tommy falls for and marries Sarah, daughter of Salieri\'s bar\'s bartender, Luigi, with whom he eventually has a daughter of his own.\r\nTommy\'s story reaches its climax when, in 1938, he and Paulie (whom, along with Sam, he\'s become close friends with) learn that Salieri\'s been smuggling diamonds in secret and keeping the profits for himself. Deciding to get back at him, they rob a bank (Sam refuses). Though the heist is successful, Tommy finds Paulie shot dead the next day. Sam calls Tommy and asks that he meet him at an art gallery. There, he learns that Sam ratted him and Paulie out to Salieri, who ordered their whacking. After a shootout, Tommy manages to kill Sam and several others. He then flees to Europe with his family, but quickly returns to set up the meeting with Norman.\r\nHis story over, Tommy makes his demands: in return for immunity for his past actions and protection, he\'ll testify against his former comrades. In the trial that ensues, 80 gangsters are tried, most are executed and Salieri gets life in prison. Tommy and his family are put under federal protection and remain safe for 13 years. However, in 1951, his past fatally catches up to him as he is shot dead by two gunman.

At this point, Kael\'Thas supposedly takes a few more days to meet up with the human forces in the city of Dalaran, the exact same city in which they stopped Illidan. Malfurion then pardons Illidan after they save Tyrande, though he does not revoke his exile. Illidan then states that he could not join the Night Elves even if Malfurion did permit it, because his master will be enraged by his failure to use the Eye properly, and will hunt him down. Illidan departs for Outland, followed by Maiev. It seems as though Maiev would chase Illidan to the depths of the world, as she would do so.

When he arrives, he finds his uncle seriously wounded. Link\'s uncle tells Link to rescue Princess Zelda from her prison, giving him a sword and shield. After his uncle dies, Link navigates the castle and rescues Zelda from her cell, and the two escape into a secret passage through the sewers that leads to a sanctuary.\r\n\r\nLink is told by a man in the sanctuary that Agahnim, a wizard who has usurped the throne, is planning to break a seal made hundreds of years ago by the Seven Sages. The seal was placed to imprison a dark wizard named Ganon in the Dark World, which was once the Sacred Realm before Ganon invaded, obtained the legendary Triforce and used its power to turn the realm into a land of darkness. Agahnim intends to break the seal by sending the descendants of the Seven Sages who made the seal into the Dark World. The only thing that can defeat him is the Master Sword, a sword forged to combat evil. To prove that he is worthy to wield it, Link needs three magic pendants. After retrieving the pendants, Link takes them to the resting place of the Master Sword. As Link draws the sword from its pedestal, Zelda telepathically calls him to the Sanctuary, informing him that soldiers of Hyrule Castle have arrived. Link arrives at the Sanctuary moments after the soldiers have vacated, where he learns from the dying man that Zelda has been taken to Hyrule Castle. Link goes to rescue her but arrives too late; Agahnim sends Zelda to the Dark World.

As soon as they arrive, Knuckles ambushes Sonic from underground with such force, he knocks the Chaos Emeralds from him, returning him to normal. Stunned, Sonic can only watch as Knuckles steals the Emeralds and disappears inland. As Sonic and Tails travel through the levels, they encounter Knuckles in almost every level.\r\n\r\nIn the Launch Base Zone, Sonic travels through to see Knuckles blow up the building that they are in. They manage to escape the building and find Dr. Robotnik. After they defeat Robotnik, he leaves his Egg-O-Matic behind. Sonic travels in it, and finds Knuckles standing on top of a pole trying to prevent Sonic from continuing onwards. As the Death Egg launches off for the second time, it knocks Knuckles off the pole sending him plummeting to the ground. Sonic travels to a platform on the Death Egg, while Robotnik awaits them there. Sonic and Tails defeat Robotnik for the last time, and the Death Egg is seen falling and exploding.\r\n\r\nThe Story continues with Sonic & Knuckles when Dr. Robotnik\'s orbital weapon, the Death Egg, has been badly damaged in the climactic battle between himself and Sonic The Hedgehog. As the satellite falls back to the Floating Island, landing in a volcanic crater, Sonic jumps off, landing in a mushroom filled woodland.\r\n\r\nSonic knows there are many Chaos Emeralds hidden on the island, including the powerful Super Emeralds and the Master Emerald, the secret to the island\'s levitation powers. Worried that Robotnik may try to harness this power to fuel a repaired Death Egg, he sets off to try and destroy the Death Egg once and for all, keeping an eye out for Knuckles the Echidna, still smarting from his Launch Base defeat.\r\n\r\nAt Hidden Palace, Sonic finds Knuckles there waiting for him. They fight and Sonic seems to emerge victorious when Knuckles flees from the duel after sensing someone is trying to steal the Master Emerald. Knuckles races ahead closely followed by Sonic to find Robotnik trying to steal the Master Emerald: It had been his plan all along to snatch it while Sonic and Knuckles were too busy dealing with each other. Realizing he had been tricked, Knuckles reacts by attacking Robotnik, which fails when Robotnik electrocutes Knuckles. Sonic tries to intervene but Robotnik stills manages to escape. Knuckles now realizes his mistake and that Sonic is in fact on his side. They join forces and teleport to Sky Sanctuary.\r\n\r\nAt Sky Sanctuary, Knuckles and Sonic watch the Death Egg launching in the background. Knuckles activates a bridge so Sonic can cross over. Sonic defeats a rebuilt Metal Sonic on the way to the Death Egg, and manages to board it before it leaves the atmosphere. Onboard the Death Egg, Sonic defeats Robotnik and destroys the ship once and for all, only for Robotnik to get away with the Master Emerald in one of his giant robots. If Sonic hasn\'t collected all seven Chaos Emeralds and/or Super Emeralds, the game ends here, and the ending in which the Master Emerald does not return to Angel Island occurs. After the credits, the player sees a scene with Robotnik still in possession of the Master Emerald.\r\nIf all the seven Chaos Emeralds and/or Super Emeralds are collected, Sonic transforms into Super Sonic or Hyper Sonic and chases Robotnik into the Doomsday Zone. After failing to lose him in an asteroid belt, Robotnik\'s machine is destroyed, Sonic and Tails return the Master Emerald, and the Floating Island becomes airborne once again. If the player didn\'t collect all the Super Emeralds, a scene occurs which shows an Egg Robo emerging from a pile of metal. If all Emeralds are collected, the player sees the Sonic 3 and Knuckles logo featuring Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles.', null, null, '1306622297', null, null, 'E - Everyone', '0', '0', '0', '0', '', 'no', '2011-05-31 04:18:40', '0', 'tv.com', 'No', null, null, '18', null, '', '', '', '', '', '', null, null, null, null);

Samus is unknowingly infected by the virus, and proceeds to return to the BSL station, when she suddenly loses consciousness and is ejected from her ship before it crashes into a nearby asteroid belt. The Galactic Federation recovers her body and discovers that the X Parasite infected Samus\'s central nervous system. They counteract the parasite\'s damage by creating a vaccine using Samus\'s cellular sample from the remains of a Metroid that Samus previously contacted. The vaccine cures Samus and also gives her Metroid-like characteristics, including the ability to absorb and use the nuclei of X Parasites for nourishment, and the Metroid\'s vulnerability to extremely cold temperatures. Her infected Power Suit is sent to the BSL station for examination, although parts of the suit are bonded to her body and cannot be removed, forming a partially-armored suit known as the eponymous Fusion Suit. The Federation sends Samus to investigate an explosion aboard the BSL station. While there, she learns that the space station is swarming with organisms that are infected with X Parasites. A group of X Parasites manage to recover and use components of Samus\'s infected Power Suit to transform into the SA-X, a form of the parasite that partially mimics Samus at full power and possesses the Ice Beam that can exploit Samus\'s weakness to cold temperatures. Samus escapes from the SA-X before it attacks her, and continues exploring the space station. She discovers a restricted lab, which the Galactic Federation is secretly using to breed Metroids. Suddenly, the SA-X appears once again, and attempts to destroy the lab, with itself in it. Samus narrowly escapes the lab before it is destroyed, and later learns that the SA-X managed to asexually reproduce before perishing, subsequently cloning itself. In addition, Samus learns that the Galactic Federation plans to capture the X and the SA-X for further study. Samus is certain that the Federation underestimates the destructive power of the X Parasites, and takes it upon herself to destroy the BSL station by setting it on a collision course with SR388. As she prepares to exit the station, she encounters an Omega Metroid, which proceeds to destroy one of the SA-X.

Further renditions of the hardware were released in 1994 by Sanyo and Goldstar. The consoles were manufactured according to specifications created by The 3DO Company, and were originally designed by Dave Needle and RJ Mical of New Technology Group. The system was conceived by entrepreneur and Electronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins. Despite a highly promoted launch (including being named Time magazine&#039;s &quot;1994 Product of the Year&quot;) and a host of cutting-edge technologies, the 3DO&#039;s high price (US$699.95 at launch), limited third-party developer support, and an over-saturated console market prevented the system from achieving success comparable to competitors Sega and Nintendo. This console was released in North America on October 4, 1993, Japan on March 20, 1994 and in Europe in 1994.', 'jHhIfhTqttI');
